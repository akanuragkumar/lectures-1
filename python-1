Your friendly neighbourhood,
NISB
AKA: How we would have liked to get started with Python!
What are we going to learn today ?
How to program in Python language?
What is the Python language and why is there a buzz about it?
Topics covered in today's class:
- Using Python Interactive shell (REPL)
- Writing Python Scripts
- Fundamental knowledge about the basic types in Python
- Defining Functions and calling them

By the end of the session, I would like everyone to be comfortable with these concepts as they are the basis of future topics.
How to Write and Run Python Code
There are two ways to run Python code:
1. interactive mode
2. script mode
Interactive Mode
In interactive mode, you type Python code and the interpreter displays the result. This is the Python REPL (Read-Eval-Print Loop).
In [1]:
print('Hello, World! This is my first line of Python')
Hello, World! This is my first line of Python
Script Mode
In script mode, you store the code in a file that ends with ".py".
Copy the above line of code in a file called hello_world.py. To execute the code in the file, you would type $ python first_program.py in a command window.
You should save your code as a script if you are writing anything more than a few lines.
Types and Variables
What is a type ?
Something that stores your data as a value.
Fundamentally, there are only 2 types of types(aka data structures) in Python:
- Mutable: which can be updated after their creation | Ex: list, dict, set
- Immutable: which cannot be modified after their creation | Ex: int, float, bool, string, tuple

What is a variable ?
An entity that refers to a value stored in memory.
Convention for naming variables
In [2]:
int1 = 5
int2 = 4
print(int1 + int2)
print(int1 - int2)
print(int1 * int2)
print(int1 / int2)
print(int1 ** int2)
print(int1 % int2)

In [3]:
float1, float2 = 3.14, 2.7
print(float1 - float2)
0.43999999999999995
In [4]:
print(5/2)
print(5.0/2)
print(5//2)
2.5

In [5]:
flag = True
print(flag)
True
In [6]:
name = 'Kshitij' # "name" is a variable which stores a value of type "string"
print(name)
Kshitij
In [7]:
type(7)
Out[7]:
int
Q. Compute the volume of a sphere of radius 7m. Hint: Use pi = 22/7
In [8]:
volume = (4/3)*(22/7)*(7**3)
print(volume)
1437.333333333333
What is a program?
A program is a sequence of instructions that specifies how to perform a computation.
Examples of what a program might do:
Check whether a number is odd or even
Print Fibonacci numbers
Help you make the world a better place
And pretty much anything!
What makes up a program?
A few basic instructions appear in just about every language:
input: Get data from the keyboard, a file, or some other device.
output: Display data on the screen or send data to a file or other device.
math: Perform basic mathematical operations like addition and multiplication.
conditional execution: Check for certain conditions and execute the appropriate code.
repetition: Perform some action repeatedly, usually with some variation.
Taking Input from User
There are only 2 ways to fetch data into your program
Prompting user to enter it
Reading data from an existing file/database
In [9]:
name = input('Enter your name:')
print(name)
Enter your name:Gopika
Gopika
Conditionals
Control flow based on conditions
In [10]:
age = 9

if age <= 19: # if statement
    # Notice the indentation
    message = 'Yay! You are a teenager.' 
    print(message)
Yay! You are a teenager.
In [11]:
age = 21

if age <= 19 and age > 12: # if statement with two conditions
    message = 'Yay! You are a teenager.' 
    print(message)
In [12]:
age = 10

if age <= 19 and age > 12: # if-else statement
    message = 'Yay! You are a teenager. :)' 
    print(message)
else:
    message = 'Alas! You are not a teenager. :('
    print(message)
Alas! You are not a teenager. :(
In [13]:
age = 10

if age <= 19 and age > 12: # if-elif-else statement
    message = 'Yay! You are a teenager. :)' 
    print(message)
elif age < 13:
    message = 'Be prepared! You are about to be a teenager. :D'
    print(message)
else:
    message = 'Alas! You are not a teenager. :('
    print(message)
Be prepared! You are about to be a teenager. :D
In [14]:
if True:
    print('This conditional is always True.')

if not False:
    print('This conditional is always not False.')
This conditional is always True.
This conditional is always not False.
In [15]:
if 1:
    print('1 is True')
else:
    print('1 is False')
1 is True
In [16]:
if 0:
    print('0 is True')
else:
    print('0 is False')
0 is False
Functions
In [17]:
def function_name(parameter1, parameter2):
    # Perform some operations on the parameters
    # return some value as a result of the computation
    pass

argument1 = 'some value'
argument2 = 'another value'
return_value = function_name(argument1, argument2)
In [18]:
def square(number):
    square_number = number*number
    return square_number

square_5 = square(5)
print('Square of 5:', square_5)
Square of 5: 25
In [19]:
def is_odd(number):
    mod = number % 2
    if mod == 1:
        return True
    else:
        return False

odd_3 = is_odd(3)
odd_4 = is_odd(4)

print('3 is odd:', odd_3)
print('4 is odd:', odd_4)
3 is odd: True
4 is odd: False
Q. Write a function to ask the user for his/her name and print a greeting "Hello, {name}"
